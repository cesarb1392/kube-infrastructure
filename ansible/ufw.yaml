    # Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is
    # being denied, rather than simply ignoring it. In these cases, use
    # reject instead of deny. In addition, log rejected connections:

        rule: reject

        log: true

    # ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
    # against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
    # address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
    # 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
    # for details. Typical usage is:
    - community.general.ufw:
        rule: limit
        port: ssh
        proto: tcp
